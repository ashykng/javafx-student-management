# Student Management System with JavaFX

A JavaFX-based Student Management System that allows users to manage student information using file-based storage. This project provides a graphical interface for adding, viewing, and updating student records.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Input and save new student records.
- **View Students**: Display a list of all students with their details.
- **Update Student**: Modify existing student records.
- **Delete Student**: Remove student records from the system.
- **File-Based Storage**: Manage student records using file-based storage (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Technologies Used

- **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Java**: For the application logic and file handling.
- **File Storage**: For storing and managing student records in files.

## How It Works

1. **User Interface**: JavaFX provides a graphical interface for interacting with the student management system.
2. **File-Based Storage**: Student records are stored and managed in files, such as CSV or JSON. The application reads from and writes to these files to persist data.
3. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on student records.
